# ROXI Implementation Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix production issues with the ROXI application.

## 1. Redis Configuration

### Issue
The application was using a hardcoded Redis URL (`redis://localhost:6379/0`) which doesn't work in production environments.

### Fix
- Modified `celery_config.py` to get the Redis URL from environment variables with a fallback to localhost
- Added enhanced Redis connection parameters for better reliability
- Improved logging to help diagnose connection issues

## 2. Database Schema Migration

### Issue
Schema mismatch between development and production environments, specifically the missing `webpage_id` column in the `text_chunk` table.

### Fix
- Created `fix_text_chunk_schema.py` migration script that:
  - Safely checks if the column exists
  - Adds the column with appropriate foreign key constraints if missing
  - Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

## 3. Background Processing

### Issue
Background processing was using in-process threading which doesn't work properly with Gunicorn's multi-worker model.

### Fix
- Updated render.yaml to add a dedicated Celery worker service
- Set up proper environment variables for both the web and worker services
- Ensured tasks use Celery's task system instead of threading

## 4. File Path Handling

### Issue
Inconsistent file path handling between development and production environments, causing file not found errors.

### Fix
- Enhanced document processing logic to try multiple file locations
- Added fallback mechanisms to find files in temp directories
- Improved error handling and logging for file operations

## 5. Health Monitoring

### Issue
No easy way to diagnose connectivity issues in production.

### Fix
- Created comprehensive `/monitoring/health-check` endpoint that tests:
  - Database connectivity
  - Redis connectivity
  - File system access
  - Temp directory access
  - System metrics

## 6. Deployment Documentation

### Issue
Deployment instructions didn't include Redis and Celery worker setup.

### Fix
- Updated `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed instructions for:
  - Automated deployment using render.yaml blueprint
  - Manual component setup (web, worker, Redis, PostgreSQL)
  - Database migration procedures
  - Troubleshooting common issues

## 7. render.yaml Blueprint

### Issue
Missing blueprint configuration for automatic deployment.

### Fix
- Created `render.yaml` with configuration for:
  - Web application
  - Background worker
  - Redis service
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Environment variables
  - Service relationships

## How To Deploy

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Use the render.yaml blueprint for automated deployment
3. After deployment, check the health endpoint to verify all components
4. If database schema issues persist, SSH into the web service and run `python fix_text_chunk_schema.py`

## Monitoring Tips

- Use the `/monitoring/health-check` endpoint to verify component status
- Check Render logs for both web and worker services
- Monitor Redis connectivity if background tasks aren't processing
