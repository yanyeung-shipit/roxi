Detection & Notification:

User uploads a PDF and the system attempts normal text extraction
If little or no text is extracted, the document would be marked as "Limited Text Content" in the document browser
A clear indicator would show in the document details page that the document may need OCR
User Interface:

A button labeled "Apply OCR Processing" would appear in the document details page for eligible documents
Clicking this would trigger the OCR job and show a progress indicator
Once complete, the interface would refresh to show the newly extracted content
Background Processing:

The OCR job would be added to the existing processing queue with appropriate tagging
Upon completion, the document would be updated with OCR-extracted text
The embeddings would be regenerated based on the new text content

Complexity and Stability Impact
This approach has a moderate complexity impact but with good stability characteristics:

Complexity Added:
Frontend Changes:

New UI elements for OCR status and triggering
Status indicators for OCR processing state
Moderate JavaScript changes for handling OCR requests
Backend Changes:

OCR processing module integration
Additional document status tracking fields
Extension of the existing processing queue mechanisms
Database Changes:

Minor schema changes to track OCR status and processing history
No fundamental data model changes required
Stability Considerations:
Isolated Processing:

On-demand OCR wouldn't affect regular document processing
OCR failures would be limited to specific documents and user actions
System-wide stability would be largely unaffected
Resource Management:

OCR jobs could be rate-limited or restricted based on server load
Processing could be scheduled for lower-usage periods
Resource allocation could be carefully controlled
Error Containment:

OCR failures would affect only the specific document being processed
Regular system functionality would continue even if OCR fails
User experience degradation would be limited to the OCR feature
