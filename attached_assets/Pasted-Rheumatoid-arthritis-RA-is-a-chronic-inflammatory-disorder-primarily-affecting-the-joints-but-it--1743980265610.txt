Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the joints, but it can also have extra-articular manifestations. It is characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to pain, swelling, and potential joint destruction over time. RA can also involve other organs, such as the heart, where it is associated with increased mortality due to heart failure [Document 1]. **Epidemiology and Risk Factors:** - The onset of RA typically peaks between the ages of 40 and 50, although it can occur at any age, including in children and adolescents. The risk increases significantly after the age of 60 [Document 2]. - Women are affected nearly three times more often than men, although this gender difference is less pronounced in older patients [Document 2]. - Genetic factors, such as the presence of the "shared epitope," increase the risk of developing RA and its severity [Document 2]. **Diagnosis and Classification:** - RA diagnosis can be challenging, especially in seronegative patients who do not have rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). In such cases, factors like bilateral joint involvement, pain at rest, morning stiffness, and the number of tender joints are predictive of RA classification [Documents 4 and 5]. **Management:** - The management of RA involves the use of synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Treatment should begin as soon as the diagnosis is made, aiming for sustained remission or low disease activity [Document 3]. - Rheumatologists are the primary specialists responsible for the care of RA patients, and treatment decisions are based on disease activity, safety, comorbidities, and structural damage progression [Document 3]. **Extra-Articular Manifestations:** - Beyond joint involvement, RA can affect other body systems, including the eyes and heart. For instance, RA patients may experience dry eye symptoms, although these do not significantly differ between those with active and inactive disease [Document 1]. In summary, RA is a complex autoimmune disease with both articular and extra-articular manifestations, requiring comprehensive management strategies tailored to individual patient needs.
