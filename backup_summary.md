# Backup Summary

## Local Backup
- Created latest backup: ./backups/code_backup_20250406_025804
- Database schema: ./backups/schema_backup_20250406_025806.sql
- Includes all essential code files and application directories
- Core files, routes, templates, static assets, and utilities backed up

## Improvements in This Version
- Enhanced DOI extraction for rheumatology journals
- Added specialized preprocessing for Journal of Rheumatology DOIs
- Fixed boundary issues in extracted DOIs (e.g., "10.3899/jrheum.220209First")
- Implemented robust pattern matching with explicit checks for common suffixes
- Added direct pattern matching for problematic cases

## GitHub Preparation
- Updated README.md with latest features and information
- Created github_backup_instructions.md with detailed steps
- Created .env.example for environment variable guidance
- Verified .gitignore settings to exclude sensitive files

## Files Ready for GitHub
- Core application files (main.py, app.py, models.py, etc.)
- Templates, routes, static assets, and utilities
- Documentation files (README.md, .env.example)
- Support scripts for maintenance and updates

## Next Steps
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Follow the instructions in github_backup_instructions.md
3. Commit and push your code to GitHub
4. Consider setting up periodic backups to the repository

## Important Notes
- Uploads directory is excluded from both the local backup and GitHub repository
- Database content should be backed up separately using PostgreSQL tools
- Environment variables and secrets are not included in backups (see .env.example)
