## Backup Information
- **Date of Backup**: April 6, 2025, at 23:52:53
- **Backup Type**: Code files and database schema (not data)
- **Source Backup**: `/backups/code_backup_20250406_235253/`

## Restoration Process
1. Created a temporary directory to test the restoration process
2. Copied all backup files to the temporary directory
3. Identified missing or updated files since the backup
4. Created a final restoration directory with updated files
5. Added newer features that were developed after the backup:
   - Webpage processing functionality
   - Updated database schemas
   - Migration scripts
   - Enhanced configuration files

## Important Post-Backup Additions Preserved
- Webpage model and functionality
- Database schema migration scripts
- Updated templates
- Enhanced utility modules
- PubMed integration updates

## Database Schema
- The database schema was preserved to maintain compatibility with existing data
- The `fix_text_chunk_schema.py` script was included to ensure proper column existence

## Next Steps
1. Review the restored application for functionality
2. Run any necessary database migrations
3. Update GitHub repository with the restored code
4. Consider implementing more frequent backups

## Note
This restoration combined the backed-up code with newer features to ensure no functionality was lost while addressing any issues that may have prompted the restoration.
